# Judgement

This mod adds a new game mode based on Judgement from Risk of Rain Returns, using Simulacrum as a base.

### Key Points

The following list should answer any questions you may have about the mod:

- This mod is compatible with Mithrix mods such as Umbral, Inferno, and AotK.
- Your health and gold persist between stages. 
- Uses Monsoon scaling, so modded difficulty scaling won't apply but other effects of the difficulty will. (higher scaling makes runs practically impossible)
- There are 5 rounds, 2 waves each (10 total waves).
- Each round has a normal enemy wave, then a boss wave.
- Items spawn around each player when spawning in.
- Regen scrap spawns a green printer in the zone next stage.
- Rusted/Encrusted Keys spawn their boxes next stage.
- Shipping Request Form drops spawn next stage.

### Item Drops

After spawning, void potentials spawn around each player, giving you 3 options from that item/equipment tier. Void cradles also spawn at specific waves. The drop tiers are consistent and are as follows:

1. **Stage 1:** *White x3, Green x1, Equip x1*
2. **Stage 2:** *White x3, Green x2*
3. **Stage 3:** *White x3, Red x1, Equip x1, Void Cradle x1*
4. **Stage 4:** *White x3, Green x1, Yellow/Boss x1*
5. **Stage 5:** *White x3, Green x1, Red x1, Void Cradle x1*
